#Chatsnap (???)

A loving clone of meatspac.es in meteor.js

##Outstanding

*Animated gifs instead of stills
*Alerts for new messages
*When no camera available, make canvas more interesting. Either let user specify a name to print, or else maybe some shapes drifting around for fun
*Display # of connections within private room?
*Linkify camera error message to re-request camera
*Fix lazy positioning of chat input bar. Also just restyle the whole thing
*Currently, images are stored as base64. Ideally they would be immediately saved as base64, and then seamlessly replaced by a properly hosted image somewhere once the upload was complete. That would require actual image storage costs though probably so screw it for now.
